        <p><em>Time in Twelves</em> is a visual clock that displays an unconventional interpretation of time using the pattern of twelves. The sketch is made using the p5.js library and updates up to the current second.</p>
        <p>The clock is created using twelve outer rectangles to represent the hour; the middle is broken up into two segments: one that tracks passing minutes (top), and one that tracks how many twelve minute intervals have passed (bottom). Each hour box grows according to the second—once the box is filled, a segment is added to the minute counter.</p>
        <p>I will say, the design is not necessarily intuitive, but it serves as my own exploration into how time is quantified and visualized. This also happens to be my first experiment with the p5.js library ever—I found it to be a powerful tool for creative coding and like that its complexity doesn't come at the cost of it being a creative medium.</p>

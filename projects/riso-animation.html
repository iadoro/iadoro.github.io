        <p>This is a risograph animation I created for my class <i>Print and Code</i> taught by Prof. Tega Brain. The primary goal of this assignment was to get used to the mechanics of the Risograph printer: splitting channels, creating masters, test prints, color theory, etc.</p>
        <p>In order to create this, I split the frames from the animation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JeN3uk2ClE&ab_channel=magicalmediamuseum" target="_blank"><i>1833 McLean's Optical Illusions (or Magic Panorama)</i></a> into contact sheets using Photoshop. The contact sheets ended up being around 80 frames. I experimented with dithering to give the lighter parts of the images a bit of noticeable texture. From there, I split the colors into their respective CMYK channels and used test prints to figure out which color would work best with each layer.</p>
        <p>I ended up going for flourescent orange and a deep blue. The printed contact sheets were then scanned and imported back into Photoshop where I cropped each image, frame by frame, and stitched them together to create a final mp4 and gif.</p>
        <p>As cool as it looks, the university's printer has a misaligned drum for the blue ink which consequently gave me skewed prints. To the trained risographer, it definitely has its mistakes, but for a first time risograph project I'd like to think it's okay.</p>

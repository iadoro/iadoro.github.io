      <p>Hi</p>
      <p>My name is Aditi. I hold a BS in computer science + a minor in studio art from UVA (spring 2023!) and am currently a MS student at NYU studying integrated design and media.</p>
      <p>I've worked in software development roles in the past (Tableau Software <3), but am currently pursuing a masters to figure out how I can translate my love for code into mediums that feel more creative and meaningful to me.</p>
      <br>
      <p>How do you like my website?</p>
      <p>I've thought a lot about the <a href="https://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html" target="_blank"> Handmade Web </a> and how special it is to create websites that are rich in character and leave room for change. I like to think of web dev as a practice of crafting and not this finalized and pristine thing that will stay the same forever. My site is made using pure html/css and vanilla javascript. It's become this platform that encourages me to experiment with javascript libraries and rethink the bounds of website making.</p>
      <p>I've set up the main page to be a playground of some of my projects (serious and fun). Some are more code heavy experiments while others are more artistic. I've organized the project index on a scale of code to art so you can get a feel of how they mesh together in my brain.</p>
      <p>Thanks for stopping by</p>
